MyRedis is a custom implementation of the Redis in-memory data structure store. This project is aimed at learning the internals of Redis and experimenting with new features.
## Features

- **Data structures**: Supports strings as key value pair.
- **Persistence**: Option to persist data to disk [Currently RDB format is supported].
- **Network server**: Clients can connect over TCP/IP to store and retrieve data.
## Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run MyRedis on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
